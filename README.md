  ## Description
  My main motivation to create this project was so that freelance developers can create their very own logo using my application. Freelancer using my application to create their logo make their life easier since my SVG logo maker is very efficent and easy to use. I built this project to showcase my newly learned object oriented programming skills. Even though it was difficult to do I still managed to overcome the obstacles that came my way during the creation of this project. The problem that this project solves is having to use other logo makers that take a very long time to create a logo while my application gives an easy and less time consuming way to create a simple logo for freelancers. Peoples' time is very valuable, that is why my SVG logo maker makes life easier since it is a very easy way to create a quick and simple logo for a company or for one's personal use. 

  ## Installation
  The first step was to install the json and inquirer packages to the file. The next step I took was to use the require method to use inquirer. The next installtion was to install jest so that I could have the ability to create test for the shapes to see if they pass. The next step was to make sure that inside the the package.json specifcally the test section there was supposed to be jest next to the tests, so that when I run tests it would use jest to run those tests. I also included a way of how to start the application by adding start and node index.js next to start, meaning that the application would start by putting in the terminal "node index.js". I also had to inlcude a gitignorw file aswell and block out the package-lock.json package inside the gitignore.
